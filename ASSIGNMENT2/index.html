    <h1>WHEN WE WERE YOUNG</h1>
    <h2> ADELE</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Everybody loves the things you do<br>
        From the way you talk<br>
        To the way you move<br>
        Everybody here is watching you<br>
        'Cause you feel like home<br>
        You're like a dream come true<br>
        <br>
    
        But if by chance you're here alone<br>
        Can I have a moment?<br>
        Before I go?<br>
        'Cause I've been by myself all night long<br>
        Hoping you're someone I used to know<br>
        <br> 
    </p>
    <p class=" chorous">
        You look like a movie<br>
        You sound like a song<br>
        My God this reminds me, of when we were young<br>
        <br>
   
        Let me photograph you in this light<br>
        In case it is the last time<br>
        That we might be exactly like we were<br>
        Before we realized<br>
        We were scared of getting old<br>
        It made us restless<br>
        It was just like a movie<br>
        It was just like a song<br>
        <br>
    </p> 
    <p>
        I was so scared to face my fears<br>
        Nobody told me that you'd be here<br>
        And I'd swear you moved overseas<br>
        That's what you said, when you left me<br>
        <br>
        You still look like a movie<br>
        You still sound like a song<br>
        My God, this reminds me, of when we were young<br>
        <br>
    </p> 
    <p class="chorous">
        Let me photograph you in this light<br>
        In case it is the last time<br>
        That we might be exactly like we were<br>
        Before we realized<br>
        <br>

        We were sad of getting old<br>
        It made us restless<br>
        It was just like a movie<br>
        It was just like a song<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When we were young<br>
        (When we were young)<br>
        When we were young<br>
        (When we were young)<br>
        <br>
        It's hard to win me back<br>
        Everything just takes me back<br>
        To when you were there<br>
        To when you were there<br>
        <br>
        And a part of me keeps holding on<br>
        Just in case it hasn't gone<br>
        I guess I still care<br>
        Do you still care?<br>
        <br>

        It was just like a movie<br>
        It was just like a song<br>
        My God, this reminds me<br>
        Of when we were young<br>
        When we were young<br>
        (When we were young)<br>
        When we were young<br>
        (When we were young)<br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p class="chorous">

        <br>
    </p>
     <p class="yelling">
        Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old<br>
        It makes me reckless<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        It was just like a movie<br>
        It was just like a song<br>
        When we were young.<br>
